;;;; This is Richard C. Waters' Series package.
;;;; This started from his November 26, 1991 version.
;;;;
;;;; $Log: s-code.lisp,v $
;;;; Revision 1.70  2000/03/25 22:16:57  matomira
;;;; Removed gratuitous consing in map-fn.
;;;; Added install and system files.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.83  2000/03/25 21:44:26  matomira
;;;; Avoided gratuitous consig in values-lists.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.80  2000/03/23 23:01:56  matomira
;;;;   NEW FEATURES:
;;;;   ------------
;;;;    - (collect 'set
;;;;      Collects a series into a list removing any duplicates in the most efficient way possible.
;;;;    - (collect 'ordered-set
;;;;      Collects a series into a list removing any duplicates but keeping the original series order.
;;;;    - SCAN now allows to drop the type specifier for any source expression
;;;;      [:cltl2-series reactivates the old 'list assumption]
;;;;    - SCAN now can scan multidimensional arrays in row-major order.
;;;;
;;;;   IMPROVEMENTS:
;;;;   ------------
;;;;    - Better code generation
;;;;      . Some fixnum declarations were further constrained.
;;;;      . Optimized scanning of constant sequences.
;;;;      . Somewhat optimized scanning of "empty" vectors, ie,
;;;;        declared to be of constant 0 length, like in
;;;;        (collect (scan '(vector t 0) <gimme-a-huge-array-to-throw-away>)
;;;;        now gives you NIL generating/executing less instructions.
;;;;        [<gimme-a-huge-array-to-throw-away> is still executed if not constantp,
;;;;         though]
;;;;      . Variables of type NULL are replaced by constant NILs.
;;;;
;;;;   BUG FIXES:
;;;;   ---------
;;;;    - Some incorrect fixnum declarations were relaxed.
;;;;    - Improved some declarations to avoid spurious range warnings regarding
;;;;      dead code by not-so-smart compilers.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.79  2000/03/21 17:18:56  matomira
;;;; Reinstated plain generation support.

;;;; Fixed letified merge-frags bug.
;;;; Adapted handle-dflow and non-series-merge for letification.
;;;; Spawned list->frag1 from list->frag.
;;;; define-optimizable-series-function uses list->frag1 to support letification.
;;;; Still can't handle all initial bindings because off-line handling seems to
;;;; move prologs into TAGBODYs.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.75  2000/03/18 20:12:52  matomira
;;;; Improved code generated by compute-series-macform-2 when trigger is t.

;;;; MERGE-FRAGS no longer depends on frag component order.
;;;; purity component of frag is now just a symbol.
;;;; Abstracted use of prolog component of frags.
;;;; Prolog letification almost works. Need to adapt MERGE-FRAGS still.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.71  2000/03/15 18:40:35  matomira
;;;; LOCALLY and letification works.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.70  2000/03/15 09:05:39  matomira
;;;; Temporary NULL-OR wrap for some declarations.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.69  2000/03/14 10:48:09  matomira
;;;; Workaround for ACL 5.0.1 TAGBODY bug added.

;;;; Fixed worsen-purity.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.66  2000/03/10 12:49:27  matomira
;;;; Letification works.
;;;; Started purity analysis.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.65  2000/03/09 13:28:03  matomira
;;;; Almost there with letification.
;;;; Activated GENERATOR deftype also for :excl.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.64  2000/03/08 18:20:35  matomira
;;;; Fixed fragL instead of *fragL bug in COLLECT.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.63  2000/03/08 17:58:24  matomira
;;;; Fixed mixed CL: before FUNCALL in DESTARRIFY.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.62  2000/03/08 12:30:53  matomira
;;;; Continued work on letification.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.61  2000/03/07 13:47:23  matomira
;;;; Removed gratuitous sorting in CODIFY.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.60  2000/03/07 08:54:20  matomira

;;;; Fixed missing CL: before FUNCALL bug.
;;;; Removed NULL-ORs by using THE.
;;;; Renamed old fragL as *fragL.
;;;; New fragL does not do *type* substitution.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.55  2000/03/03 19:17:14  matomira
;;;; Series 2.0 - Change details in RELEASE-NOTES.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.51  2000/02/23 15:27:02  toy
;;;; o Fernando added an indefinite-extent declaration and uses
;;;;   it in the one place where it's needed.
;;;; o Fernando renamed split-assignment to detangle2 and
;;;;   corrected some bugs in my version.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.50  2000/02/22 23:37:22  toy
;;;; Remove the cmu version from scan-range.  It was generating bad
;;;; initialization code for things like (scan-range :length 10 :type
;;;; 'single-float).
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.49  2000/02/22 22:25:51  toy
;;;; o One of Fernando's uses of dynamic-extent was wrong, as Fernando
;;;;   points out.
;;;;
;;;; o CLISP apparently has a bug in loop such that split-assignment is
;;;;   broken.  Replace that with an equivalent do loop.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.48  2000/02/22 15:21:38  toy
;;;; Fernando added dynamic-extent declarations wherever needed.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.47  2000/02/11 14:45:42  toy
;;;; Let's not use fix-types for CMU in optimize-producing.  This means the
;;;; compiler can't optimize things as well as it could, and I (RLT) want
;;;; to see these warnings.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.46  2000/02/10 17:15:11  toy
;;;; Fix a typo that got in the last few patches:  LET should really be
;;;; CL:LET.  (From Fernando.)
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.45  2000/02/09 22:46:00  toy
;;;; Changed all occurrences of defunique to be just defun and added a
;;;; comment on where the function is called.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.44  2000/02/08 17:08:36  toy
;;;; o As discussed with Fernando, the "optional" type is renamed to
;;;;   null-or.
;;;; o Cleaned up and indented some of the comments.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.43  2000/02/04 23:05:57  toy
;;;; A few more changes from Fernando:
;;;;
;;;; o All functions called from a single site are defined with DEFUNIQUE
;;;;   for documentation purposes (and eventual inlining via DEFEMBEDDED).
;;;; o Fixed the long standing bug that install uninterned everything that
;;;;   it didn't like.  Shadowing import is used now.
;;;;
;;;; There were some other changes that I (RLT) don't understand.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.41  2000/02/04 16:34:30  toy
;;;; o  Some more changes from Fernando.  This fixes some bugs that show up
;;;;    in the test suite.  The test suite now passes on CMUCL.
;;;;
;;;; o  Fixed up some declarations that used the optional type when, in
;;;;    fact, it didn't.  (Hope I got these all right.)
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.40  2000/02/03 17:30:08  toy
;;;; Two major fixes:
;;;;
;;;; o Bug in collect (missing set of parens)
;;;; o Change some defconstants back to defvar.  (Tickles CMUCL inf loop).
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.39  2000/02/02 21:31:44  toy
;;;; Here are the changes that Fernando made.  I (RLT) don't claim to
;;;; understand everything that was changed or why.
;;;;
;;;; 1. Removed 1 redundant eval-when
;;;; 2. Sorted functions so that it can be loaded w/o `undefined function'
;;;;    warnings.
;;;; 3. Added inline declarations for all functions called from a single
;;;;    site.
;;;; 4. Sorted functions so that inlining will work even if a compiler does
;;;;    not inline forward references to functions defined in the same
;;;;    file.
;;;; 5. Setup eval-when's so that it can be compiled w/o having to load the
;;;;    source first.
;;;; 6. Simplified redundant (OR NULL T) to T
;;;; 7. Simplified redundant #'(lambda (x) (foo x)) to #'foo where foo is a
;;;;    function.
;;;; 8. Fixed so it won't complain when LispWorks adds
;;;;    CLOS::VARIABLE-REBINDING declarations after CLOS macro
;;;;    transformations (general support provided via the constant
;;;;    allowed-generic-opts).
;;;; 9. Added support for MACROLET on LispWorks (necessary because of CLOS
;;;;    macro transformations).
;;;; 10. Only declare variables as (OR foo NULL) on implementations that
;;;;     won't allow to store NIL otherwise (currently, only CMUCL).
;;;; 11. Added specialization to series declarations (eg: (SERIES FIXNUM)).
;;;; 12. Do more precise type propagation in PRODUCING forms.
;;;; 13. Allow `SETF like SETQ' in PRODUCING forms.
;;;; 14. Added COLLECT-PRODUCT.
;;;; 15. Extended SETQ-P to take into account multiassignments (not used
;;;;     yet). This should still be trivially generalized to support PSETQ
;;;;     and SETF, BTW.
;;;; 16. Added DEFTYPE for GENERATOR so that LispWorks and CMUCL won't
;;;;     complain "because it's not a list" (IT IS!!)
;;;; 17. Replaced PROCLAIMS with DECLAIMS.
;;;; 18. Replaced DEFVARs with DEFCONSTANTs where appropriate.
;;;; 19. Removed function namespace pollution by defS-generated code.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.38  2000/01/20 18:19:21  toy
;;;; Merged 1.32.2.2 (Fernando's changes) with 1.37.
;;;; I hope I got this right.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.32.2.2  2000/01/20 18:05:26  toy
;;;; Merged the changes between 1.32 and 1.37 into this revision.
;;;; This should merge my changes with Fernando's.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.32.2.1  2000/01/20 17:51:45  toy
;;;; Checking in the changes from Fernando Mato Mira <matomira@iname.com>
;;;; with the hope of merging our two versions together.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.32  1999/07/02 20:37:39  toy
;;;; Moved the package stuff out to a separate file.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.31  1999/07/02 15:09:49  toy
;;;; o  Need explicit package qualifier for multiple-value-bind in
;;;;    init-elem.
;;;; o  Reordered some of the tests in init-elem.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.30  1999/07/01 16:44:23  toy
;;;; A comment was in the wrong place.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.29  1999/07/01 14:15:39  toy
;;;; o  "Pekka P. Pirinen" <pekka@harlequin.co.uk> supplied a new version
;;;;    of aux-init (and init-elem).  This is probably better.  I added one
;;;;    additional case.
;;;;
;;;; o  Added simple-base-string to the tests in decode-seq-type.  (Needed
;;;;    by the new aux-init.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.28  1999/06/30 19:34:49  toy
;;;; "Pekka P. Pirinen" <pekka@harlequin.co.uk> says:
;;;;
;;;;    "Tests 289, 290, 417, and 426 [on Liquid CL] fail because of
;;;;    incorrect type decls generated in ADD-PHYSICAL-OUT-INTERFACE.
;;;;    The variable NEW-OUT is used for two conflicting purposes; The
;;;;    fix is to split it into two."
;;;;
;;;; Thanks!
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.27  1999/04/29 22:06:49  toy
;;;; Fix some problems in aux-init not handling some strings and
;;;; bit-vectors correctly.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.26  1999/04/23 17:51:24  toy
;;;; For CMUCL, decode-seq-type didn't handle base-string types.  Make it
;;;; work.
;;;;
;;;; In aux-init, change the test for simple-string to be string instead.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.25  1999/04/15 17:09:41  toy
;;;; Rework aux-init once again.  The bit-vector entry goes away, and the
;;;; entry for vector and simple-array are changed to create the proper
;;;; types when the length is not given.  I hope this is the last change
;;;; here! :-)
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.24  1999/04/15 16:35:54  toy
;;;; In aux-init, the bit-vector entry is actually applicable to all Lisps
;;;; because bit-vectors would get initialized to #() instead of #*, which
;;;; is wrong.  Remove the CMU conditionalization.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.23  1999/04/13 16:51:32  toy
;;;; o  Back up the gensym changes made in 1.21 because CLISP doesn't like
;;;;    it.
;;;; o  type-expand for CLISP is in the LISP package.
;;;; o  For CMUCL, in aux-init need to check for bit-vector before
;;;;    simple-array because simple-bit-vector was done as simple-array
;;;;    instead of bit-vector, which is wrong.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.22  1999/04/09 12:32:26  toy
;;;; Add definition of canonical-type for CLISP.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.21  1999/04/08 21:46:08  toy
;;;; Use gensym instead of gentemp, which is deprecated in ANSI CL.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.20  1999/04/08 21:41:16  toy
;;;; Add CLISP to the Series-ANSI.  Then need to import COMPILER-LET.
;;;;
;;;; In aux-init, the bit-vector entry is only for CMUCL which
;;;; canonicalizes (vector bit) into bit-vector.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.19  1999/04/06 18:36:13  toy
;;;; Some fixes from Arthur Lemmens <lemmens@simplex.nl>:
;;;; MAKE-SEQUENCE was being called with things like (BIT-VECTOR BIT) and
;;;; (STRING STRING-CHAR).  Change DECODE-SEQ-TYPE to convert BIT-VECTOR's
;;;; and STRING's to the the underlying array types.  Also change
;;;; STRING-CHAR to CHARACTER.
;;;;
;;;; This change necessitates adding a BIT-VECTOR case in AUX-INIT. (This
;;;; is probably only need by CMUCL where CANONICAL-TYPE actually does
;;;; something.)
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.18  1998/06/12 20:45:23  toy
;;;; An addition to scan-hash for CLISP.  This reduces consing and should
;;;; be at least as fast.  From Bruno Haible.
;;;;
;;;; Also, defstruct alter-fn needs to be defined twice for CLISP and
;;;; probably also for CMUCL.  From Brun Haible.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.17  1998/06/10 18:59:51  toy
;;;; Fixed long-standing bug in scan-range where the initial values of the
;;;; loop variables didn't match the specified :type.  I'm not sure this is
;;;; the correct solution, but it seems to produce the desired macro
;;;; expansions.  I would be interested in a better solution, if possible.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.16  1998/06/08 17:34:59  toy
;;;; Couple of small changes for CLISP.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.15  1998/05/26 16:23:25  toy
;;;; One last fix from Reginald:  Don't make series a declaration.  With
;;;; this fix, this should now run correctly for lispworks.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.14  1998/05/24 19:19:22  toy
;;;; Fixes from Reginald S. Perry were incompletely applied:  Forgot to
;;;; import compiler-let and messed up a fix for uninterning SERIES for
;;;; Harlequin.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.13  1998/05/21 15:18:27  toy
;;;; Added a few fixes from "Reginald S. Perry" <reggie@aa.net> to make
;;;; this work with LWW.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.12  1997/10/02 13:36:45  toy
;;;; Forgot to export scan-stream.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.11  1997/10/02 13:25:18  toy
;;;; Added canonical-type function to extract out the "real" type if
;;;; something has been deftype'd.  Changed code to support this new
;;;; function.
;;;;
;;;; Do a better job in decode-seq-type.  Needed for CMUCL to complain
;;;; less.
;;;;
;;;; Added scan-stream series function.  Just like scan-file, except that
;;;; we have a stream instead of a file name.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.10  1997/01/16 14:38:27  toy
;;;; Took out part of Tim's last change: Removed tests for :defpackage
;;;; feature.  Gcl with M. Kantrowitz's defpackage doesn't work and I'm too
;;;; lazy to figure out why.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.9  1997/01/16 14:26:44  toy
;;;; Some more patches from Tim (tfb@aiai.ed.ac.uk):  Conditionalize on
;;;; :defpackage too for package stuff.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.8  1997/01/16 14:23:59  toy
;;;; Put in changes from Tim (tfb@aiai.ed.ac.uk) to conditionalize on
;;;; Series-ANSI.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.7  1997/01/16 14:20:23  toy
;;;; GCL normally doesn't have defpackage, so don't use defpackage form.
;;;; It also doesn't have a "CL" package, so rename "LISP" to
;;;; "COMMON-LISP" with appropriate nicknames.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.6  1997/01/13 17:47:19  toy
;;;; Added some changes from Tim Bradshaw (tfb@aiai.ed.ac.uk):
;;;;   Replace "LISP:" with "CL:"
;;;;   Added :import-from for Genera and Allegro.
;;;; With these changes, everything still works under CMUCL.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.5  1997/01/13 16:04:11  toy
;;;; Don't install the package on load.  Let the user do it himself.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.4  1997/01/10 22:37:03  toy
;;;; A patch from Tim Bradshaw that fixes a bug.  The code walker
;;;; improperly handles nth-value.  Doesn't seem to have any affect in
;;;; CMUCL but can be seen in others like lispm.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.3  1997/01/07 19:09:30  toy
;;;; Changed aux-init to initialize variables better.  I think it handles
;;;; just about all cases now.
;;;;
;;;; Modified clean-dcls to handle simple-arrays.
;;;;
;;;; Changed collect so that it handles types better by passing the correct
;;;; type to fragL.  This allows better optimization by the compiler (at
;;;; least for CMUCL).
;;;;
;;;; Added code at the end so that the package is installed whenever it's
;;;; loaded.  You don't have to explicitly install the package anymore.
;;;; However, there's a bug:  It assumes you were originally in the USER
;;;; package.  This needs to be fixed.
;;;;
;;;; Revision 1.2  1997/01/07 18:58:51  toy
;;;; Changes from Paul Werkowski to make series work/run under CMUCL.
;;;; Raymond Toy added the defpackage stuff.  There are probably other
;;;; changes here, but I wasn't careful to keep everything straight,
;;;; unfortunately.

;;; There cannot be any redundancy in or between the args and aux.
;;; Each ret variable must be either on the args list or the aux list.
;;; The args and ret have additional data as discussed below.  The aux
;;; is just a list of lists of a symbol and a type specifier.  Every
;;; symbol used in a frag which could possible clash with other frags
;;; (eg args, rets, aux, and also labels) must be gensyms and unique
;;; in the whole world.
;;;
;;; The order of the args is important when the frag is first
;;; instantiated and funcalled.  However, it does not matter after
;;; that. Similarly, the order of the rets also matters at the time it
;;; is instantiated, and at the time that a whole expression is turned
;;; into one frag, but it does not matter at other times.
;;;
;;; There are two basic kinds of frags, series frags and non-series
;;; frags.  A non-series frag is a frag which just has a simple
;;; computation which has to be performed only once.  The rets and
;;; args must be non-series values, and the body and epilog must be
;;; empty.  (The code below maintains the invariant that if all the
;;; ports of a frag are non-series then the body and epilog are
;;; empty.)
;;;
;;; A frag has three internal parts so that a wide variety of
;;; fragmentary series functions can be compressed into a single frag.
;;;
;;; Inside frags there is a label which has a special meaning.
;;;  END is used as the label after the end of the loop created.  If the
;;;     body of a fragment contains (go END) then the fragment is an
;;;     active terminator.
;;;
;;; If a programmer uses these symbols in his program, very bad things
;;; could happen.  However, it is in the series package, so there
;;; should not be any conflict problems.  the code in this file
;;; assumes in many places that no symbol in the "SERIES" package can
;;; possibly clash with a user symbol.
;;;
;;; The code field is used solely to generate error messages.
;;; However, it is never the less very important.  In particular, it
;;; is important that the code field only contain things that were
;;; actually in the user's source code.  It is also important that it
;;; always contain something.
;;;
;;; There are several reasons why the code might end up being
;;; something the user did not write.  The foremost reason is macro
;;; expansion.  It might be the result of some expansion that turns
;;; into a frag.  To fix this, my-macroexpand saves the first form
;;; before macro expansion, and puts that in the code field.  To make
;;; this work, it must be the case that every macro that can possibly
;;; expand into something that will trigger the process of converting
;;; an expression into a loop must call PROCESS-TOP.  To ensure this
;;; it must be the case that every macro the user can type must be
;;; defined with defS or DEFUN with an OPTIMIZABLE-SERIES-FUNCTION
;;; declaration.  (Note it is fine for things the user cannot type
;;; anyway to be defined with defmacro.)  (Unfortunately, the end user
;;; can break this rule if they define a new collector with DEFMACRO,
;;; but you cannot make everything work.  At least all they will see
;;; is things generated by their own macro)

;;; optional argument can end up having the default value which ends up
;;; in the annotation.

;;; If there is an on-line-spot, it must appear in the frag code exactly
;;; once at top level.  It cannot be nested in a form.  It also can only be
;;; referred to from a single input or output.

;;; A number of functions depend on the fact that frags and syms are list
;;; structures which can be traversed by functions like nsubst.  The
;;; following three circular pointers are hidden in an array so they
;;; won't be followed.  (Note that ins only have prv and rets only have
;;; nxts, as a result, they can both be stored in the same place.  two
;;; names are used in order to enhance the readability of the program.)

;;; The sym vars are symbols which appear in the body of the frag
;;; where they should.  All of the symbols must be unique in all the
;;; world.  Every instance of the symbol anywhere must be a use of the
;;; symbol.
;;;
;;; Output variables can be freely read and written. Input variables
;;; can be read freely, but cannot ever be written.
;;;
;;; These restrictions guarantee that when frags are combined, it is
;;; OK to rename the input var of one to be the output var of the
;;; other.  In addition, the creator of an output can depend on the
;;; output variable being unchanged by the user(s).  However, this is
;;; not the main point. More critical is the situation where two frags
;;; use the same value. The second frag can be sure that the first
;;; frag did not mess up the value. (Side-effects could still cause
;;; problems.  The user must guard against destroying some other
;;; fragment's internal state.)
;;;
;;; In the interest of good output code, some work is done to simplify
;;; things when frags are merged.  If an output is of the form (setq
;;; out c) where c is T, nil, or a number, then c is substituted
;;; directly for the input.  Substitution is also applied if c is a
;;; variable which is not bound in the destination frag.  In addition,
;;; other kinds of constants are substituted if they are only used in
;;; one place.  A final pass gets rid of setqs to variables that are
;;; never used for anything.

(defmacro free-out (s) ;var output is assigned to if any.
  `(off-line-exit ,s))

;;; only inputs can have off-line exits, so we can reuse the same
;;; field for this.  if an output is assigned to a variable on
;;; *renames*, the variable is recorded here.  This is used in some
;;; situations to hook up data flow correctly.  It also indicates a
;;; few additional things.
;;;
;;;  (A) you cannot every kill this ret, because you may need it even if
;;;      you do not need it for dflow by nesting of expressions.
;;;
;;;  (B) if you have it still existing at the end of everything, because
;;;      it was never used, then this is something to issue a warning about,
;;;      but it is not a value to be returned by the expression as a whole.
;;;
;;; The third key internal form is a graph of frags.  This is
;;; represented in an indirect way.  The special variable *graph*
;;; contains a list of all of the frags in the series expression
;;; currently being processed.  The order of the frags in this list is
;;; vitally important.  It corresponds to their lexical order in the
;;; input expression and controls the default way things with no data
;;; flow between them are ordered when combined.  In addition, many of
;;; the algorithms depend on the fact that the order in *graph* is
;;; compatible with the data flow in that there can never be data flow
;;; from a frag to an earlier frag in the list.
;;;
;;; Subexpressions and regions within the expression as a whole are
;;; delineated by setting marking bits in the frags in the region.
;;;
;;; lambda-series makes special frags for arguments which are not in
;;; the list *graph*.  They exist to record info about the arguments
;;; and to preserve an invariant that every input of every frag in
;;; *graph* must have data flow ending on it.  A related invariant
;;; states that if a frag in *graph* has a ret then this ret must be
;;; used either by having dflow from it, or as an output of the
;;; expression as a whole.  Unused rets are removed from frags when
;;; the frags are created.
;;;
;;; for the purposes of testing whether a subexpression is strongly
;;; connected to its outputs, a frag with no rets is considered to be
;;; an output of the subexpression.

;;;;                ---- FUNCTIONS FOR CODE WALKING ----

;;; M-&-R takes in a piece of code.  It assumes CODE is a semantic
;;; whole.  Ie, it is something which could be evaled (as opposed to a
;;; disembodied cond clause). It scans over CODE macroexpanding all of
;;; the parts of it, and performing renames as specified by *RENAMES*.
;;; M-&-R puts entries on the variable *RENAMES* which block the
;;; renaming of bound variables.
;;;
;;; M-&-R also calls FN (if any) on every subpart of CODE (including
;;; the whole thing) which could possibly be evaluated.  The result of
;;; consing together all of the results of FN is returned.  Ie, the
;;; result is isomorphic to the input with each part replaced with
;;; what FN returned.  This is done totally by copying.  The input is
;;; not altered.
;;;
;;; In addition, M-&-R checks to see that the code isn't setqing
;;; variables it shouldn't be.
;;;
;;; In order to do the above, M-&-R has to be able to understand
;;; fexprs.  It understands fexprs by having a description of each of
;;; the standard ones (see below).  It will not work on certain weird
;;; ones.
;;;
;;; fexprs are understood by means of templates which are (usually
;;; circular) lists of function names.  These fns are called in order
;;; to processes the various fields of the fexpr.  The template can be
;;; a single fn in which case this fn is called to process the fexpr
;;; as a whole.

;;;; ---- PHYSICAL REPRESENTATIONS FOR SERIES AND GENERATORS ----

;;; The following structure is used as the physical representation for
;;; a series.  It is a structure so that it can print itself and get
;;; read in.  The only operation on it is to get it to return a a
;;; generator object.  The only operation on a generator object is
;;; NEXT-IN.

;;; Physical series are of two kinds basic and image. A basic series
;;; has three parts
;;;
;;; GEN-FN is a fn that generates new values.  When called with no
;;; args, must either return a list of the next value, or nil
;;; indicating no more values to return.  (If there is an alter
;;; function, then each value is actually a list of the fundamental
;;; value and any additional information needed by the alter function.
;;; NEXT-IN only returns the fundamental value in any case.)
;;;
;;; DATA-SO-FAR cons of NIL and data generated by GEN-FN so far.  The
;;; last cdr is a flag that tells you whether the end has been
;;; reached.  If it is T there is still more to get, if it is NIL you
;;; are done.  (The NIL car is needed so that new elements can allways
;;; be added by side effect.)
;;;
;;; ALTER-FN is a fn that alters elements (or NIL if none).  Must be a
;;; function that when called with a new item as its first arg and any
;;; additional information computed by the GEN-FN as its other
;;; arguments does the alteration.
;;;
;;; Image series compute one series from another without requiring any
;;; mutable internal state.  The also have four parts.
;;;
;;; BASE-SERIES the series the image series is based on.  The elements
;;; of the image are some simple function of the elements of the base.
;;; (The base can be another image series.)
;;;
;;; IMAGE-FN is a function with no changing internal state that will
;;; get the next full item of the series given a generator of the base
;;; series.  It must behave the same as BASIC-DO-NEXT-IN.
;;;
;;; IMAGE-DATUM Some non-null value that can be used by the IMAGE-FN
;;; when deciding what to do.  This often saves having to have the
;;; IMAGE-FN be a closure. It is passed as the second argument to the
;;; IMAGE-FN.
;;;
;;; ALTER-FN same as for a basic series.

;;;;                         ---- MERGING A GRAPH ----

;;; This proceeds in several phases
;;;  (1) check for series/non-series type conflicts.  This operates in
;;;      one of two different ways depending on the value of
;;;      *SERIES-IMPLICIT-MAP*.  If this control variable is non-nil then:
;;;      (a) If a frag that does not process any series at all 
;;;          (i.e., came from totally non-series stuff in the source) receives
;;;          a series for any of its inputs, then it was implicitly mapped
;;;          by isolate-non-series. (Note, if the output is not connected to 
;;;          anything, it is marked as being forced to run.)
;;;      (b) If a non-series is supplied where a series is expected, we
;;;          coerce it into an infinite series of the single value.
;;;      Whether or not *SERIES-IMPLICIT-MAP* is non-nil we then:
;;;      (a) if a series is supplied where a non-series is expected,
;;;          issue a restriction violation warning.
;;;          It would not be in the spirit of things to create a physical series.
;;;          And would be very hard to boot.
;;;      (b) if a non-series is supplied where a series is expected,
;;;          assume that this non-series item is really a physical series and
;;;          add a physical interface.  (Note this cannot happen when
;;;          *SERIES-IMPLICIT-MAP* is non-nil.)
;;;  (2) Do substitutions to get rid of trivial frags representing constant values and
;;;      references to variables.
;;;  (2.5) get rid of dead code.
;;;  (3) Scan the graph to find places where the expression can be split because it is
;;;      in disconnected places or there is an isolated dflow touching a non-series
;;;      or off-line port.  If the graph cannot be split, then it consists solely of
;;;      dflow connecting on-line ports.  A list structure is created showing all of
;;;      the split points that will be merged in the next step.
;;;  (4) The structure created above is evaluated doing a sequence of merge steps
;;;      that reduces the whole expression to a single frag.
;;;
;;; since implicit mapping is a bit tricky, but quite possibly the
;;; must useful single part of the series macro package, it deserves a
;;; few words.  To understand what happens, some initial definitions
;;; are necessary.  First, a compile-time-known series function is one
;;; of the predefiend series functions or a function DEFUNed with an
;;; optimizable-series-function declaration. (There may be lots of
;;; other functions around manipulating series, but that is not
;;; relevant to the implicit mapping that is going on here.) A
;;; compile-time-known series value is a series output of a
;;; compile-time-known series function or such an output bound to a
;;; variable by one of the forms below.  A compile-time-known series
;;; input is a series input of a compile-time-known series function.
;;;
;;; Every non-compile-time-known function that receives a
;;; compile-time-known series value as an input is mapped.  Note that
;;; once a non-compile-time-known function is mapped, the result is a
;;; compile-time-known series function this may cause ;more mapping to
;;; occur. Special forms are never mapped.  This is flagged as an
;;; error if it appears that it needs to be done.  Note that
;;; non-series functions that appear in a context where their value is
;;; not used, are flagged to indicate that they must be run anyway.
;;; This carries through it they are mapped.
;;;
;;; In addition to the above, any non-series value that appears where
;;; a series is expected is automatically converted into an infinite
;;; series of that value.  If you side-effects are involved, you might
;;; want multiple evaluation.  However, you will have to specifically
;;; indicate this using map-fn or something.  (This may not be the
;;; best default in many ways, but it is the only way to make things
;;; come out the same without depending on the exact syntactic form of
;;; the input.  For instance note that INCF expands into a let in some
;;; lisps and this would force the let to be in a separate expression
;;; even though it does not look like it at first glance.)

;;; As an example of all the above consider the following.
#|
(let* ((x (car (scan '((1) (2) (3)))))
       (y (1+ x))
       (z (collect-sum (* x y))))
  (print (list x y 4))
  (print z)
  (collect (list x (catenate #Z(a) (gensym)))))
|#
;;; is equivalent to
#|
(let* ((x (#Mcar (scan '((1) (2) (3)))))
       (y (#M1+ x))
       (z (collect-sum (#M* x y))))
  (collect-last (#Mprint (#Mlist x y (series 4))))
  (print z)
  (collect (#Mlist x (catenate #Z(a) (series (gensym))))))
|#

;;; Note that compile-time-known series functions are never
;;; mapped. Therefore (collect (collect (scan (scan x)))) is not
;;; equivalent to (collect (mapping ((y (scan x))) (collect (scan
;;; y)))).  You have to write the latter if you want it.  Also while
;;; series/non-series conflicts are less likely to arise, there is no
;;; guarantee that the restrictions will be satisfied after implicit
;;; mapping is applied.

;;; Merging frags connected by series dflow touching at least one
;;; off-line port is where the key difficulties lie.  There are three
;;; areas of trouble. First, things have to be carefully arranged so
;;; that termination will work out right in situations where not every
;;; termination point is connected to every output.  Second, if an
;;; off-line output is connected to an off-line input, one of the
;;; frags has to be turned inside out.
;;;
;;; Third, operations concerning these issues and even the simple
;;; cases of off-line merging can convert extraneous on-line ports
;;; (one not directly participating in the merging) into off-line
;;; ports.
;;;
;;; (One issue here is that we must be sure that this port is
;;; isolated. We know it is, because it cannot be an extraneous port
;;; on the frag unless it is either a port on the expression as a
;;; whole (and therefore touched by no dflow) or touched by isolated
;;; dflow.)
;;;
;;; When conversion to off-line happens as part of the internal course
;;; of events, it indicates that the code is going to get messy, but
;;; need not concern the user.  (In fact, the code may even be quite
;;; efficient, it will just look like a real mess.)  Note that if you
;;; are just writing a simple series expression that neither reads nor
;;; writes a series as a whole, there will be no externally visible
;;; series ports, and you need not worry about this issue.
;;;
;;; However, when you are defining a new series functions, there are
;;; external series ports.  Given that on-line ports are much more
;;; usable than off-line ones, it is unfortunate that doing odd things
;;; with the termination (for example) can make all your ports be
;;; off-line.
;;;
;;; Two cases are always simple.  If an extraneous input or output
;;; carries a non-series value, then there is never a problem.  If it
;;; is an input than it must be available from the very start of
;;; computation and therefore will always be readable no matter how
;;; the frags are combined.  If the port is an output, then it does
;;; not need to be available until after everything is done, and the
;;; strongly connected check insures that it will be eventually
;;; computed.
;;;
;;; Things are also basically simple if an extraneous input or output
;;; is off-line.  In this situation, a specific marker says exactly
;;; where connected computation should be put, and this marker will
;;; always end up in an appropriate place no matter how the fragments
;;; are combined. The only thing which requires care is making sure
;;; that these markers stay at top level.
;;;
;;; One problem case, however, is that it is possible for an off-line
;;; output to be used by an off-line input.  This can cause a splitting
;;; to happen that ends up in a situation where an off-line output is used
;;; both internally and externally.  If so, the output has to be
;;; preserved the first time it is used so that it can be used again.
;;;
;;; On the other hand, if an extraneous input or output is on-line,
;;; significant complexities can arise.  If an extraneous port is
;;; on-line then it may have to be changed into an off-line
;;; port. Fortunately, things are arranged so that a graph is never
;;; split by breaking an on-line to on-line data flow.  However, an
;;; on-line port can be on one end of a broken data flow.
;;; Nevertheless, most instances of extraneous on-line ports come from
;;; weird lambda-series bodies. Except in simple situations extraneous
;;; on-line ports are not supported unless they come from complete
;;; expressions.
;;;
;;; Consider the simplest mergings first.
;;;
;;; Two frags are connected by non-series dflow (or no dflow). (When
;;; processing complete series expressions it will always be the case
;;; that both frags are non-series frags.  Further, the way splitting
;;; happens guarantees that any series ports are direct ports of the
;;; expression as a whole.)
;;;
;;; Merging is trivial as long as at least one of the frags is
;;; non-series.  If one has series ports, it can be left totally
;;; alone.  The other can be placed entirely in the prolog (if it is
;;; first) or epilog.
;;;
;;; If both frags are series frags, things are complex.  You must
;;; evaluate the first one first and completely to get the non-series
;;; output(s) (if any) that are used by the second.  This will force
;;; the first frag to make all its outputs normally.  Then you have to
;;; evaluate the other one.  To do this, one frag or the other has to
;;; be severely distorted.  This process will make all of the series
;;; ports on the modified frag be off-line.
;;;
;;; The program below converts the first frag into a tight loop that
;;; runs in the beginning of the body.  (This is essential to preserve
;;; the invariant that off-line-spots are only in bodies, but it makes
;;; a real mess and forces all the series inputs off-line.  Also note
;;; the way the prolog of the other frag has to be moved.)  (Note that
;;; the off-line ports created are isolated, because they are on the
;;; outside of the expression as a whole.)


;; This is used for the variable renaming part of all kinds of dflow.
;; Rets must be saved either if they have no dflow from them (they are
;; outputs of the whole top level expression) or if there is a dflow
;; to a frag that is not currently being dealt with.  The functional
;; argument specifies which dflow are which.

;;; A graph of many frags is connected solely by on-line data
;;; flow. (Here, even when operating on complete series expressions,
;;; it is expected that there are extraneous series inputs and
;;; outputs, and that internally used series ports can be used outside
;;; as well.  However, every external use must be isolated.)
;;;
;;; Here things are in general simple, and everything can just be
;;; merged together in an order compatible with the dflow and
;;; everything will be fine and all of the extraneous ports will be
;;; left alone.
;;;
;;; However, if there are any termination points that are not
;;; connected to every output point, we have a problem.  Things have
;;; to be altered so that these termination points don't prematurely
;;; stop things they should not stop.  This is done by inserting flags
;;; that delay termination until the correct time.  This is done as
;;; follows.
;;;
;;; (1) find each termination point and output point.  Test each
;;; termination point to see whether it is total (i.e., is connected
;;; to every output and therefore calls for stopping everything.)
;;; Total termination points can act by simply branching to END when
;;; they trigger.
;;;
;;; If a termination point is not total, then a flag has to be
;;; gensymed corresponding to it and the point has to be changed so
;;; that it sets the flag (which starts with a value of NIL) to T
;;; instead of branching when exit occures.  For non-total termination
;;; points that are series inputs, this means that the input will have
;;; to become an off-line port that catches termination.
;;;
;;; (2) for each non-total termination point we have to figure out
;;; what frags it controls.  First, frags the termination point has
;;; data flow to are forced to stop when it stops.  Second, once EVERY
;;; output a frag has data flow to has been completed, the frag can
;;; stop too.
;;;
;;; (In addition, we must note that once every frag has stopped, the
;;; loop as a whole should stop.  If there is at least one total
;;; termination point and there is at least one output point that is
;;; controlled only by total termination points, then we don't have to
;;; do anything special.  When a total termination point stops
;;; everything stops and we always have to continue computing as long
;;; as none of the total termination points have stopped.  However, if
;;; the above is not the case, we have to add a new termination test
;;; that checks to see if all of the outputs have completed, and stop
;;; everything.)
;;;
;;; (2a) follow the dflow from each non-total termination point and
;;; note that the termination point itself, and every frag you reach
;;; must stop as soon as the termination point does.  This is done by
;;; adding FLAG into the list of control flags for each frag.  (This
;;; list is an implicit OR that specifies when to STOP executing the
;;; frag)
;;;
;;; (2b) Start at each output point and get the set of flags that
;;; control it. Follow the dflow backward from each output point and
;;; note what frags feed into it.  Once this is done, create a new
;;; entry (AND (OR . output-flag-set1) (OR . output-flag-set2) ...) in
;;; the list of control flags.
;;;
;;; The above can be done in two highly efficient marking sweeps.  The
;;; first of which also determines whether there are any non-total
;;; termination points we have to worry about.
;;;
;;; Finally, we simplify each of the control expressions and do the
;;; merging inserting the correct tests of flags.  (I could think
;;; about sorting the frags as much as possible consistent with dflow
;;; so that adjacent frags have the same expressions, however, this
;;; might be bad with respect to side-effects.)

;;; flag meanings
;;; 1- marks region of interest.
;;; 2- marks places to start output point sweep.
;;; 4- marks places to start termination point sweep.
;;; 4- mark individual output points and termination points.

;;; other splits.) However, any dflow touching these ports must be
;;; isolated.) Note that if the output port is on-line there may be
;;; other dflow starting on it other than the one in question.
;;;
;;; The first difficulty in this case involves termination.  With
;;; regard to the second frag, there is no problem.  If the second
;;; frag is the first to stop, then it must have produced all its
;;; outputs.  If the first frag is the first to stop, then it must
;;; have produced all its outputs which either means that the second
;;; must also stop, or the second will catch the termination of the
;;; first.
;;;
;;; Further there is no trouble with the first frag as long as either
;;; (1) the second frag has no termination points other than the one
;;; in question (i.e., has no series inputs without off-line-exits
;;; other than possibly the one in question and cannot by itself
;;; terminate) or (2) the first frag does not have any output points
;;; other than the one in question (i.e., has no other outputs, and
;;; does not have the must-run flag set) and this output is not used
;;; anywhere other than by the input in question.  In case (1) running
;;; the second frag forces the complete running of the first frag.  In
;;; case (2), it does not matter if the first frag is run completely
;;; or not.
;;;
;;; If neither of the cases above applies, we have to do some hard
;;; work.  We know that the destination frag is a termination point
;;; and either, (a) the source frag has a non-series output or has the
;;; must-run flag set or (b) there is data flow from series outputs of
;;; the source frag to more than one place (i.e., either fan out from
;;; one, or dflow from two different ones).
;;;
;;; In case (a) things are simple, we just have to change the
;;; destination frag so that it always reads all of the elements of
;;; the input in question. This can be done by catching the
;;; termination of the frag caused by other things, and using a flag
;;; to force execution to continue until the input runs out.  This
;;; transformation causes all the other series ports to become
;;; off-line.
;;;
;;; Case (b) is more complex, the source frag might not be able to
;;; terminate at all, and even if it can, it might not terminate soon
;;; enough.  We must look at all of the destinations of dflow from it
;;; (not just the one we are looking at now) and see which ones of
;;; them are termination points.  What we want is for the source to
;;; terminate exactly when all of the destinations terminate (if
;;; ever).  If at least one of the destinations is not a termination
;;; point, then we can proceed exactly as in case (a).  If none of
;;; them are, then we can still proceed the same, but we have to add a
;;; test to the first frag that causes termination as soon as all of
;;; the destinations have stopped.  This requires flags to be set in
;;; the destinations.
;;;
;;; (Note that we could probably use simpler frags and things if we
;;; figured out all the places where we were going to have to do this
;;; before merging the on-line subexpressions in the first place.
;;; However, this would make the code more complex and is not worth
;;; doing given that it is rather unlikely for series expressions to
;;; have more than one output in any case.  Note that the prior
;;; version of this macro package just outlawed every problematical
;;; case.  Doing things with more efficiency is a possible future
;;; research direction.)
;;;
;;; The second difficulty involves actually doing the merging.
;;;
;;;   A- The ret is off-line and the arg is on-line There are two
;;;   basic ways in which this can be handled.
;;;
;;;  A1- The most straightforward way is to insert the arg frag into
;;;  the off-line-spot in the ret-frag.  This is very simple and
;;;  allows on-line inputs and outputs of the ret-frag to remain

;;;
;;;  A2- The ret-frag is turned inside out and converted into an
;;;  enumerator, which has on-line data flow to the arg-frag.  This
;;;  requires the use of a flag variable, and the making off-line of
;;;  any on-line inputs or outputs of the ret-frag.  However, it
;;;  allows any extraneous inputs and outputs of the arg-frag to
;;;  remain unchanged.
;;;
;;;  If either of the two frags has no extraneous on-line ports, then
;;;  the appropriate combination method above is used and everything
;;;  works out great. If they both have extraneous on-line ports, then
;;;  which every one has fewer of these ports has them changed to
;;;  off-line ports and the appropriate process above is then applied.
;;;
;;; In either case, special care has to be taken to insure that the
;;; off-line output will still exist if it is used some place other
;;; than in the arg-frag. (It is possible that it will exist, but will
;;; get changed to on-line.  This does not cause confusion since the
;;; input it is connected to must be off-line--otherwise there would
;;; be only one dflow from the output.)
;;;
;;;   B- The ret is on-line and the arg is off-line.  This case is
;;;   closely analogous to the one above.  Again, there are two basic
;;;   ways to proceed.
;;;
;;;  B1- The most straightforward way is to insert the ret frag into
;;;  the off-line-spot in the arg-frag.  This has the feature that it
;;;  is very simple and allows all on-line inputs and outputs of the
;;;  arg-frag to remain unchanged. However, on-line inputs and outputs
;;;  of the ret-frag are forced to become off-line.
;;;
;;;  B2- The arg-frag is turned inside out and converted into a
;;;  reducer which receives on-line data flow from the ret-frag.  This
;;;  requires the use of a flag variable, and it forces off-line any
;;;  extraneous on-line inputs or outputs of the arg-frag.  However,
;;;  it allows any extraneous inputs and outputs of the ret-frag to
;;;  remain unchanged.
;;;
;;; If either of the two frags has no extraneous ports, then the
;;; appropriate combination method above is used and everything works
;;; out great.  If the both have extraneous ports then whichever has
;;; fewer has them changed to off-line and things proceed as above.
;;;
;;;   C- the ret and arg are both off-line.  Here it is not possible
;;;   to simultaneously substitute the frags into each other.
;;;   However, it is possible to combine them after A2 is applied to
;;;   the ret-frag or B2 is applied to the arg-frag.  Again this
;;;   presents two options and it is possible to preserve either the
;;;   extraneous ports of the ret-frag or the arg-frag, but not both.
;;;
;;; Note we have to be prepared for the general case more often than
;;; you might expect, because the combination process can cause ports
;;; to become off-line.

;;; This finds internal non-series dflows and splits the graph at that

;;; be possible that either of the parts will have more non-series
;;; dflow in it.  To see this, note the following example:
#|(let ((e (scan x)))

;;; The order of frags on the graph is going to be scan, collect,

;;; from car to collect-last is going to be pulled into the first

;;; The best we can do is construct one part so that it is known that

;; At this next stage, we split based on off-line ports.  (Note that all
;; non-series splitting must be totally complete at this time.)  Several
;; other things are important to keep in mind.  First, whenever we split on
;; an off-line output that has more than one dflow from it to on-line ports,
;; we insert a dummy identity frag so that there will be only one dflow from
;; the off-line port to on-line ports (the multiple dflows come from the
;; output of the dummy frag).  There are three benefits to this.  First,
;; doing this allows us to make the split cutting only one dflow arc.  This
;; guarantees that both parts remain connected and therefore we don't have to
;; call disconnected-split again.
;;
;; Second, when checking for isolation when doing splitting at the
;; same time, we need to have the property that doing a split cannot
;; cause a non-isolated arc to become isolated.  If we cut more than
;; one series dflow when splitting we could make something else be
;; isolated. Consider the program below.
#|(let ((e (split #'plusp (scan x))))
    (collect (#M+ e (f (g e))))) |#
;; Note that the offline output of split is isolated, but neither the
;; input of f or the output of g is isolated.  If you cut both dflows
;; from the split when doing a split, these two ports look isolated in
;; the part they are in.
;;
;; Third, the dummy frag helps keep things straight during later
;; merging.  The key problem is that if there is more than one on-line
;; destination port, then we must make sure that they stay on-line,
;; because they may not be isolated.  The dummy frag essentially
;; records the requirement that the destinations must keep in
;; synchrony.
;;
;; Note that when splitting, things will come out exactly the same no
;; matter which part is minimized, because the whole expression is
;; connected and there is no non-series dflow.  As a result, there
;; cannot be more than one way to split the expression---Every
;; function must be forced to one half or the other.
;;
;; By the same argument used with regard to non-series dflow, either
;; part can still have off-line ports in it that have not been split
;; on.
;;
;; Note that even if the whole does not have any external series
;; ports, the two pieces can.  At least one will be off-line, the
;; other can be on-line.  Note that if the splitting is being done

;;; A note on types.  Things are set up so that every aux variable
;;; (except the variable that is necessary when a non-series input is
;;; not a constant) is given a type declaration whereas inputs are
;;; never given types.  This ensures that everything is given a type
;;; definition and only once.  The only exception is that a user can
;;; use a type decl in a series::let which will then override the
;;; default type.  You can also wrap a (THE TYPE ...) around any
;;; series function call to override the types of the output.

;;; Some types are given in the form (series-element-type var) where
;;; var is a series input.  A final pass substitutes this type if it
;;; can be found.  Note that this is a purely one-way propagation of
;;; information starting on the inputs. The final pass also discards
;;; any type declarations which are T.

(provide "SERIES")

;;; ------------------------------------------------------------

;;; some things added since the last documentation
;;; #nM for returning multiple values
;;; Note #M does odd stuff with the keywords for keyword arguments, but
;;;   there is nothing we can do about this, because the documentation is very 
;;;   clear on what #M does.  If your are using implicit mapping,
;;;   #M is unnecessary anyway.
;;; *series-implicit-map*, note the detailed rules for when mapping
;;;   happens, which are much like OSS was, but more conservative.
;;;   We never map a function unless we MUST---i.e., only when one of
;;;   its actual arguments is a series.  We never map a special form except IF.
;;;   The virtue of this is that it is applicable on a single function
;;;   by single function basis, and gets the same results no matter what
;;;   the input looks like syntactically.  (Note you might not get portable
;;;   resuls. if some standard macro expands into code with an IF in one
;;;   implementation and without in another.)  (Note the forced evaluation
;;;   of non-series functions that are not last in a let etc. is already done.)
